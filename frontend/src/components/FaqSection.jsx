    question: "How do I start investing in real estate with ESTADEFI?",
    answer:
      "Starting is simple: 1) Connect your crypto wallet, 2) Complete KYC verification, 3) Browse available properties, 4) Purchase REALFi tokens representing your chosen property. You can start with as little as â‚¹8,000 (0.1 ETH)."
  },
  {
    question: "How is my investment legally protected?",
    answer:
      "Each property on ESTADEFI is secured through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) structure. Your REALFi tokens represent legal ownership in this SPV, ensuring that your investment is backed by real property rights under Indian law."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I receive rental income from my property investment?",
    answer:
      "Rental income is automatically distributed to token holders in the form of $ETD tokens based on your ownership percentage. These distributions happen daily and can be viewed in real-time on your dashboard."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need to sell my investment quickly?",
    answer:
      "Unlike traditional real estate, ESTADEFI offers instant liquidity through our secondary marketplace where you can sell your REALFi tokens 24/7. You can sell part or all of your investment at any time."
  },
  {
    question: "Is ESTADEFI compliant with Indian regulations?",
    answer:
      "Yes, ESTADEFI is building a SEBI-compliant framework for tokenized real estate. Our legal team works closely with regulatory experts to ensure all investments meet current and upcoming regulatory requirements."
